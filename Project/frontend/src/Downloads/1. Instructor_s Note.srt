00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,310
Hi, welcome to this course.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,700
Before you start, let me explain you a few things.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,700
See, the first point is how to follow this course.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,230
See if you have taken this course for academic purposes.

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,060
If you have Java programming as your subject, then I suggest you follow the codes right from the beginning

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,040
and follow the lectures in the same order.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,940
Don't skip anything.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,550
Whatever the section that comes under your syllabus, you can cover them if any section is not in the

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:32,950
syllabus.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,190
You can skip it the next.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,820
If you already know Java and you are preparing for campus interviews and already you know the things,

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,950
then you can skip the topics.

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,870
But whichever topic you're selecting, please make sure that you are listening to all the lectures in

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,530
that section.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,520
If you directly jump on a particular video, then you may not understand everything from it because

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,870
the topics are related in a particular section.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,660
So please start the section from the beginning, although I don't directly jump on a particular topic

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,620
inside a section.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,950
And if you are from industry and if you want to brush up any particular topic, then you can go ahead.

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,690
You might be having working experience.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,980
Also, you can watch any lecture.

22
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,860
Then the next thing is about ressource.

23
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,930
Fee for the coding lectures where I am showing you the program.

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,380
So after watching that lecture, you try to write on the program by yourself.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,110
And if you face any difficulty, then you can go to resources, you can download the resource.

26
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,320
That same program is available in the form of a resource.

27
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,450
You can click on the link and download it.

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,190
So just beside that lecture on the return site, you'll find a list of lectures, right?

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,560
So under the same lecture, the one you are watching, you will find a link called Resource.

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,780
Click on it and the program will be downloaded on your machine.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,470
Make sure that the popup blocker is disappeared and still, if you face any difficulty, you are unable

32
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,880
to remove the error, then you can contact me in question answer section just below every lecture down

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,210
here.

34
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,440
On the right hand side, just below the belly button, you'll find Kushan answers.

35
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,270
So question answers.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
You can ask a question.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,730
And if the question is related to the code, then I suggest you copy paste the code there so that I

38
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,660
can easily check your program and help you with the errors.

39
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,510
So that's all go ahead and try to watch it without skipping any lectures.
